# FooDev

## Instruction

- Create a new project that has routing file and sets `scss` as default stylesheet:
  - We don't want to use any file test spec.ts.
> ng new foodev --routing=true --style=scss

  - Skip all test file:
    - Open angular.json file:
  
```json
{
  "schematics": {
    "@schematics/angular:component": {
      "style": "scss",
      "skipTests": true
    }
  }
}
```
