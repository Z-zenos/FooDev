        ? Why we use our src inside square bracket:
        ! Because by using square brackets for the name of
          attribute, we can pass dynamic data to it.
        ! If we remove this bracket, it will be just the literal
          string and to make it dynamic, we need to put it
          inside double curly brackets
        ! We can use both the style but I prefer to use square
          bracket for the attributes that are completely dynamic
          and not use brackets for the situation that data is
          not dynamic or semi-dynamic.
